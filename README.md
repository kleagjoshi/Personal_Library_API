Chapter, personal library app which allows you to keep track of your reading activity.
In the end of Home page you can sign up to create an account and access our lirary or you can login if you already have registered.
The library page displays all books available in the library.
If you login as admin (email: admin@admin.com, password: Admin@123), you can add books to the library, edit or remove them.
Also, the admin profile allows you to keep track of the number of books, authors and users in the library.
As a user, you can search for books and you can move these books to the wish list by pressing Read Me button. 
You can access your wish list on the profile page. When you are ready to start reading, go
to your wish list and press Start Reading. Then the book will move to your reading 
list, where you can update your progress.
Buttons are functional so you can move books around all pages.

We have also provided the txt file with some book examples for testing, it is in the frontend project file.
